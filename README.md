Task-1 Online Reservation System 

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an Online Reservation System that allows users to book, view, and manage reservations for transportation, events, 
or other services. The system aims to simplify the booking process, reduce manual work, and provide real-time access to reservation data for both customers and administrators.

Steps Performed

Requirement Analysis
     Identified the core features: user registration, login, booking form, view reservations, cancel reservations.
     Decided on the database structure for storing user and reservation details.
System Design
     Created an ER diagram to represent database relationships.
     Designed the frontend UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend Development
     Used Java to implement booking, retrieval, and update logic.
     Integrated JDBC for MySQL database connectivity.
Database Setup
     Created MySQL database reservation_db with tables for users and bookings.
     Inserted sample records for testing.
Feature Implementation
     Added login and signup validation.
     Implemented “View All Reservations” feature for admins.
     Added “Cancel Reservation” functionality.
Testing
    Tested each module independently (unit testing).
    Performed integration testing for end-to-end workflows.

Tools Used

Programming Language: Java
Database: MySQL
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
Server: XAMPP (for MySQL server)
Version Control: Git (optional)

Outcome

The Online Reservation System successfully allows:
Users to register, log in, and make reservations.
Admins to view all reservations and manage bookings.
Secure and structured storage of data in MySQL.
A user-friendly interface for easy navigation.

Task 4-Online Examination System

Objective

The purpose of this project is to create a Java-based Online Examination System that allows users to register, log in, and take online exams with a time limit 
and automatic submission. The system is connected to a MySQL database to manage user details and exam data securely.

Steps Performed

Database Setup
   Installed MySQL and created a database named online_exam.
   Created necessary tables like users for storing user information.
   Connected the database to Java using JDBC.
Java Development
   Developed the main menu with options for Register, Login, and Exit.
   Implemented the Register function to store new users in the database.
   Implemented the Login function to validate credentials from the database.
   Added the exam interface with a timer and automatic submission.
Testing
   Tested registration with multiple users.
   Verified login credentials and access control.
   Tested timer functionality for the exam.
   
Tools Used

  Java (JDK 17) – for application development.
  Eclipse IDE – for writing and running Java code.
  MySQL – for database management.
  JDBC – for connecting Java to the MySQL database.
  
Outcome

  Successfully created a functional Online Examination System.
  Users can register and log in securely.
  Exam is conducted with a timer and auto-submit feature.
  Data is stored and retrieved from the MySQL database.
